i'm currently taking vocal lessons with the wonderful [thomas truhitte](http://www.thomastruhitte.com/)! my favorite pieces are musical theatre
classics (les mis, chicago, phantom etc.) and ones sung by soprano ingénues. i'm also trying to get back into acting for the first time in nearly a decade!
(i used to do performances at acpa and gilroy gardens.)

in the past, i did flute for six years (four years in symphony orchestra), piano for eight years, and classical voice for three years.
i still put those hats on every now and then :)
