i'm currently taking vocal lessons with the wonderful [thomas truhitte](http://www.thomastruhitte.com/)! my favorite pieces are musical theatre
classics (les mis, chicago, phantom etc.) and broadway pieces for soprano ingénues. i'm also getting back into acting! 

in the past, i did [flute](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvUe5H_qmeidvCzgC6qQvUjjIj69AB4CQ&si=x2FPQU0wqvPphe6a) for six years (four years in symphony orchestra), piano for eight years, and classical voice for three years.
i still put those hats on every now and then :)
