i've been involved with distance running for almost seven years now, starting in high school cross country and track
(where i was varsity captain of cross country for two years and track's distance captain for one year).
i also raced on [cal tri](https://www.caltriathlon.com/), uc berkeley's club triathlon team (swim / bike / run) for two years! 

nowadays, i primarily run for fun, and am currently dabbling a little in strength training. i've written
about some of my experiences [here](/blog/running-down-a-double-edged-sword) and [here](/blog/an-unexpected-close-captains-reflection-on-four-years-cross-country), 
and have been featured on the saratoga falcon [here](https://saratogafalcon.org/29022/sports/finding-fitness-at-uc-berkeley/) and [here](https://saratogafalcon.org/12047/sports/sophomore-dedicates-herself-pre-season-running/).
