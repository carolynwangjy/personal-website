i've always loved writing, and always will! i most often [blog](https://medium.com/@carolynwangjy) nowadays, but i am getting back
into creative writing (crossing my fingers on some new work coming out soon)!

i'm an alumna of the kenyon review young writers workshop and the 
juniper young writer's institute, which i attribute much of my creative writing work too.
i have also been lucky enough to be recognized by the scholastic art and writing awards,
the new york times, the journalism education association of norcal, and national history day.

you can sift through my work [here](/writing) :)
