i've always loved writing and always will! i most often [blog](https://medium.com/@carolynwangjy) nowadays, but i am getting back
into [creative writing](/writing?sort=topic) (crossing my fingers on some new work coming out soon)!

i'm an alumna of the kenyon review's [young writers workshop](https://kenyonreview.org/high-school-workshops/) and umass amherst's 
[juniper institute for young writers](https://www.umass.edu/juniper-young-writers/) on a full-merit scholarship, which i attribute much of my creative writing work too.
i am also quite proud of the saratoga falcon newspaper, which won a [silver crown](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/news/cspa-2024-crown-awards-finalists-news-publications) from the columbia scholastic press
association during the year i led as editor-in-chief.

my personal writing has been lucky enough to be recognized by the scholastic art and writing awards,
the new york times, the journalism education association of norcal, and national history day.

you can sift through my work [here](/writing) :)
