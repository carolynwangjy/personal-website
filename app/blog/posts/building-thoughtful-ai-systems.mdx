i think the best of courses always involves a syllabus that compels people to think and write
about what they're reading, coding, and learning.

which makes me incredibly excited that karina and kevin's [course](https://www.posttraining.ai/) on post-training,
sponsored by a few of my favorite profs in berkeley's eecs department,
compels us to jot down our thoughts in a somewhat comprehensible, publishable manner.
