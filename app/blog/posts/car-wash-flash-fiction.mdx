    A tiny figure lumbered to the grass lawn holding a bucket full of pink tinted foam and water, her large overalls drooping between her legs. She crouched down and stared at her car’s windshield in front of her, her face tilted slightly at a 15º angle. Scrunching up her nose, she carefully examined the vehicle from all sides. The doors. The windows. The wheels.
	
    “Dirty,” she muttered, fingering the bits of dirt off the door handle. Her hair swept in front of her face as she pulled herself up, and she swatted at the strands impatiently.
	
    “Stop. Blocking.”
	
    The determined pout on her face transformed into a cheekish grin as she submerged her two hands into the bucket and brought out a dripping toothbrush and a squeeze tube full of glistening blue toothpaste. With considerable effort, she popped open the cap and pressed her chubby fingers to the sides of the tube, whispering,
	
    “Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.”
	
    A plop of paste dropped onto the grass, and with one smooth movement, she scooped it up with her hands and smeared it onto the car in front of her.
	
    “Good, good, good,” she giggled. 

    Then she grabbed her toothbrush and began scrubbing vigorously, watching as the toothpaste smeared over the fine pink paint of the car’s exterior in a sticky mess. After she finished, she squatted and lifted the bucket, grunting as half of its contents nearly spilled on her head. Then with one intense, almost violent squeal, she poured the entire bucket of water onto the car, watching in fascination as the bits of remaining pink foam dripped and merged with the toothpaste.

    Satisfied, she threw the bucket, toothbrush, and squeeze tube aside, picked up the car with her stubby hands, and licked the remaining residue off her fingers.

    “Carwash? Check,” she declared seriously. “Now I need to give Barbie a nice shower before she tours daddy’s office in her new sparkly car.”
